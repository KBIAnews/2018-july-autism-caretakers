                <p>After her son Gabriel was diagnosed with autism, Audra Meeks says she was devastated. Then, her youngest son Jacob was also diagnosed.</p>
                <p>Audra and her four children live in Auxvasse, Missouri. Gabriel is 6 now, and Jacob is 4. Audra spends her every waking moment trying to prevent disaster. While both boys are in therapy four days a week, new behaviors and challenges often emerge in place of previous ones.</p>
                <p>The carpet had to go because Jacob was eating it. Holes gape in the drywall from a time when headbanging was bad. Then there was the fecal smearing and the constant nakedness and urination.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;It's constant; it's relentless,&rdquo; Audra said. &ldquo;It is relentless every day.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Parents of children with autism are at greater risk for elevated levels of stress compared to parents of children with other special needs, according to Allison Wainer, assistant research director of the Autism Assessment, Research, Treatment and Services Center in Chicago.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I think part of it is related to the one of the core difficulties in autism is difficulty for the child to communicate,&rdquo; Wainer said. &ldquo;And so, when your child can't tell you what's wrong and instead they maybe scream and cry or withdraw even more from the world &hellip; as a parent, it's a really hard and oftentimes painful experience to try to navigate those situations.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>One in 70 Missouri children are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The diagnosis covers a wide range of behaviors, meaning caregivers of people with autism also have a spectrum of experiences. Five mid-Missouri families shared a snapshot of their lives caring for a person with autism.</p>

                <h2>“I don't remember a lot from that time period, let's put it that way.”</h2>
                <p>To Logan Arnett&rsquo;s parents, he was the perfect baby.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We thought we were awesome parents,&rdquo; mom Tara Arnett said. &ldquo;He was probably too well-behaved for his age in hindsight &hellip; He didn't need us. He never cried for us. He was just happy.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>As Logan neared age 2, Tara and her husband Brock Arnett started to worry.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I asked the pediatrician, &lsquo;At what point do we worry about autism?&rsquo;&rdquo; Tara said. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re asking, then we&rsquo;re worried.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
                <p>For the Arnetts, Logan&rsquo;s diagnosis coincided with many major life changes. Brock got laid off from his job, and Tara was juggling Logan&rsquo;s slew of appointments with caring for a newborn.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I don't remember a lot from that time period, let's put it that way,&rdquo; Tara said. &ldquo;It was overwhelming at best.&rdquo;</p>

                <aside class="pquote">“Even ‘It's OK’ ended up not being ok.”</aside>
                <p>But life for caregivers is often overwhelming on a moment-to-moment basis as well.</p>
                <p>Three minutes into her shower, Audra didn&rsquo;t hear Jacob&rsquo;s iPad anymore. She called his name. No answer. She ran out of the bathroom, shampoo in her hair and a towel around her chest.</p>
                <p>The window above the sink was open, and Jacob was gone.</p>
                <p>Still in a towel, Audra ran out the garage, jumped in her van and turned right down the road. A few blocks over, she saw him. He was naked, sprinting through a field toward the busy highway.</p>
                <p>She ditched the van and chased him down, catching him 15 feet from the road.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;He was yelling, &lsquo;Cars, cars, cars!&rsquo;&rdquo; Audra said. &ldquo;It was that simple. He wanted the cars, and he was gonna go get the cars on the highway.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>A <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/5/870">2012 study</a> from the American Academy of Pediatrics surveyed more than 1,200 children with autism and found nearly half had tried to run away after age 4. Of those who went missing, &ldquo;24 percent were in danger of drowning and 65 percent were in danger of traffic injury.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Jacob is always looking for ways to escape, meaning that Audra must keep all doors and windows secure.</p>
                <p>Audra&rsquo;s constant hypervigilance has affected her health, leading to several trips to the doctor and a recent hospitalization.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I had all these odd things&mdash;like a loss of appetite, daily headaches and weight loss,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Even though I was exhausted, I had insomnia going on. And the doctor was like, &lsquo;That's stress at its finest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Audra&rsquo;s stress levels aren&rsquo;t abnormal for her situation, according to Jennifer Pinto-Martin, University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing executive director.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;The stress on the caregiver of a child with autism, the stress on the family, in general, is incredibly high,&rdquo; Pinto-Martin said. &ldquo;People don't recognize that it's just this ongoing constant barrage of challenges.&rdquo;</p>

                <h2>&ldquo;He does not see himself as one of <em>those</em> kids.&rdquo;</h2>
                <p>For Pamela and Jason Smith, their 14-year-old son TJ Smith&rsquo;s transition to high school next year will mean navigating a lot more than a new class schedule and locker combination.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;He's going to ride a regular bus with all the other kids,&rdquo; Pamela said. &ldquo;I want him to have an assigned seat right behind the bus driver so he knows that's where TJ sits every day &hellip; Getting off a bus at a high school with 2,000 kids just flooding off of buses and going into school at the same time &mdash; he'd easily get overwhelmed.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>TJ currently attends Smithton Middle School. He answers direct questions, but he doesn&rsquo;t start conversations. He likes math but reads on a second grade level. His parents said they&rsquo;ve been lucky to have teachers who are willing to adapt materials to TJ&rsquo;s learning style.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;They're willing to change a test for him, so instead of having a multiple question test ... the teacher might be having a conversation with him to ask him what he knows about that subject,&rdquo; Pamela said. &ldquo;He knows the material and knows what they're talking about; he just couldn&rsquo;t write you an essay about it.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>While he attends some special education classes meant for students with intellectual or learning disabilities, the Smiths said TJ identifies socially with students in mainstream classes.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t see himself as one of <em>those</em> kids,&rdquo; Pamela said. &ldquo;He sees himself as a gen-ed kid, which is totally fine. But unfortunately, gen-ed kids don't see him as a gen-ed kid."</p>
                <p>Tj&rsquo;s parents have avoided discussing his diagnosis with him.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We want him to be able to think and feel whatever he wants because he can,&rdquo; Pamela said &ldquo;...We don't want this diagnosis, our word, to limit him.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Our kids with autism sometimes have a hard time navigating the social dynamics of the school system,&rdquo; Wainer said. &ldquo;There might be an increased risk for bullying or victimization, and that is obviously really stressful and hard for parents to manage.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>While the Smiths haven&rsquo;t had issues with bullying in middle school, they worry about the new social situation awaiting TJ at Battle High School next fall.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;He wants to be included, but, at the same time, he knows that he can't,&rdquo; Jason said. &ldquo;I mean, he knows he can't have a full conversation with someone, and that hurts. That sucks.&rdquo;</p>

                <h2>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to be all alone in this world.&rdquo;</h2>
                <p>For mom Jamie Henderson, who raises her son Jaxon on her own, long-term anxieties compound day-to-day worries.</p>
                <p>She doesn&rsquo;t know if the 7-year-old will be able to live independently as an adult, and she knows she won&rsquo;t be around forever.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;It's very scary, because I'm just &mdash; I'm hoping I live a very long time, but once I'm gone, and if my mom is gone, then who is going to be there?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My brother is there with his wife and his girls, but what if he's not there? Then he's going to be completely alone in this world, and it just stresses me out.&rdquo;</p>
                <p><strong>[Insert Video 2]</strong></p>
                <p>Regular therapy and routine give Jamie hope that Jaxon will reach independence, but as Jaxon has gotten older, Jamie has started going to a counselor and attending church to find solace and ways to cope.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I've never been a big churchgoer, but the past year or two, we've been going to church,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I pray about it a lot. I usually end up just bawling and praying to God, &lsquo;Just get me through this. Help me remain calm.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

            <section id="fern">
                <p>Fern Anderson fell into the autism caregiver role overnight, after her son&rsquo;s girlfriend called 20 years ago.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;[She] said my son was either drunk or drugged out, and she had called the police,&rdquo; Anderson said. &ldquo;... He had been involved in drugs and alcohol for quite some time, and I knew it. I knew it was bad.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Anderson drove to her son&rsquo;s house and got there before the police did. She took her then-4-year-old granddaughter, Norma Jo Anderson, and went home. Fern got legal custody shortly thereafter.</p>
                <p>Growing up with her grandmother, now-24-year-old Norma struggled with a combination of undiagnosed Asperger Syndrome and a tumultuous early childhood.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I will admit that there was &mdash; at one time, I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to do it, because she had so much anger,&rdquo; Fern said. &ldquo;She was trying to take it physically out of on me.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>After being diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome as a junior in high school and attending several years of anger management classes, Norma now has a job with Columbia Public Schools helping with lunch at Rock Bridge High School. She also helps teach a kindergarten Sunday school class at her church.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;It was the anger,&rdquo; Fern said. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Norma; it was the anger.&rdquo;</p>

                <p><strong>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be doing it, too&rdquo;</strong></p>
                <p>With a child&rsquo;s future independence often uncertain, autism caregivers can grapple with the prospect of caring for their child indefinitely.</p>

            <p>For the hundreds of rural hospitals struggling to stay in business, health policy decisions made in Washington D.C. this summer could make survival a lot tougher.</p>
            <p>Since 2010, at least <a href="http://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/">79 rural hospitals</a> have closed across the country, and nearly <a href="https://www.ruralhealthweb.org/NRHA/media/Emerge_NRHA/PDFs/02-02-16PI16NRHAreleaseoniVantagestudy.pdf">700 more</a> are at risk of closing. These hospitals serve a largely older, poorer and sicker population than most, making them particularly vulnerable to changes made to Medicaid funding.</p>
            <p>“A lot of hospitals like ourselves that see a lot of the Medicaid population could get hurt,” says Kerry Noble, CEO of Pemiscot Memorial Health Systems, the public hospital in the poorest county in Missouri.</p>
            <p>The GOP’s American Health Care Act would cut Medicaid — the public insurance program for low-income children, elderly and disabled Americans —&nbsp; by $834 billion, which would result in 14 million more Americans being uninsured in the next 10 years. Even more could lose coverage under the budget proposed by President Donald Trump, which proposes an additional $610 billion in cuts to the program.</p>
            <p>That’s a problem for small rural hospitals like Pemiscot Memorial, which are disproportionately dependent on Medicaid. The hospital serves an agricultural county that ranks worst in Missouri for <a href="http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/missouri/2017/rankings/pemiscot/county/outcomes/overall/snapshot">most health indicators </a>including premature deaths, quality of life and even adult smoking rates. Closing the county’s hospital could make those much worse.</p>
            <p>But a rural hospital closure affects more than just healthcare. Jobs, property values, even schools can suffer. Pemiscot County already has the state’s <a href="http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/missouri/2017/measure/factors/23/data?sort=desc-4">highest</a> unemployment rate. Losing the hospital would mean losing the county’s largest employer.</p>
            <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="http://media.kbia.org.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/june/pemiscot-medicaid/kerry_intextconsequences.mp3" data-start="0" data-end="21440" data-plays="1">“It would be devastating economically,” Noble says. “Our annual payrolls are around $20 million a year.”</span></p>
            <p>All of that weighs on Noble’s mind when he ponders the hospital’s future. Pemiscot Memorial&nbsp;has already struggled with its dependence on Medicaid for more than a decade. Its story is a lesson in how decisions made by state and federal lawmakers have put these small hospital’s on the edge of collapse.</p>
            <h2>Blueprints From a Happier Time</h2>
            <img class="img-side img-side-right" src="./img/noble.jpg" alt="Kerry Noble">
            <p>Back in 2005, things were very different in Pemiscot County. The hospital was doing well, and Noble commissioned a three-phase, $16 million plan to completely replace their outdated facilities, which were built back in 1951.</p>
            <p>“We were going to pay for the first phase of that in cash. We didn’t even need to borrow any money for it,” Noble says while thumbing through the old blueprints in his office at the hospital.</p>
            <p>Those renovations never happened. In 2005 the Missouri legislature passed <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/2/w335.full">sweeping cuts</a> to its Medicaid program. More than 100,000 Missourians lost their health coverage and this had an immediate impact on Pemiscot Memorial’s bottom line. About 40 percent of their patients were enrolled in Medicaid at the time, and nearly half of them lost their insurance in the cuts.</p>
            <aside class="pquote">
            The Missouri legislature passed sweeping cuts to its Medicaid program - more than 100,000 Missourians lost their health coverage. This had an immediate impact on Pemiscot Memorial’s bottom line.</aside>
            <p>Those now-uninsured patients still needed care, though, and as a public hospital, Pemiscot Memorial couldn't just turn them away.</p><p>“So we’re still providing care, but we’re no longer being compensated,” Noble says.</p><p>And as their uncompensated care went up, the hospital’s already-slim margins went down. In 2007, the first full year of the Medicaid cutbacks, the hospital’s net income dropped by $2 million from the year before. Then for the next six years the hospital netted a profit only twice, both times well under $1 million.</p>
            <p>Forget renovations, the hospital went into survival mode.</p>
            <h2>A Lost Lifeline</h2>
            <p>The Affordable Care Act was supposed to help with the problem of uncompensated care. It offered rural hospitals a potential lifeline by giving states the option to expand Medicaid to a larger segment of their populations. In Missouri that would have covered about 300,000 people.</p>
            <p>“It was the fundamental building block [of the ACA] that was supposed to cover low-income Americans,” says St. Louis University health law professor Sidney Watson.</p><p>In Missouri Kerry Noble and&nbsp;Pemiscot&nbsp;Memorial became the poster children for Medicaid expansion. In 2013 Noble went to the state capital to&nbsp;<a href="http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/mo-house-democrats-file-medicaid-expansion-bill">make the case</a>&nbsp;for expansion on behalf of the hospital.</p>
            <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="http://media.kbia.org.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/june/pemiscot-medicaid/kerry_intext_expansion.mp3" data-start="0" data-end="21000" data-plays="1">“[Our facility] will no longer be in existence if this expansion does not occur,” Noble told the crowd at a press conference.</p><p>But the Missouri legislature voted against expansion. This was not good news for&nbsp;Pemiscot&nbsp;Memorial or the other rural hospitals in the state.</span></p>
            <p>“Medicaid cuts are always hard to rural hospitals,” Watson says. “People have less employer-sponsored coverage in rural areas and people are relying more on Medicaid and on Medicare.”</p><p>Against all odds, though, Pemiscot County hospital is still in existence. At least for now.</p><p>To survive, the hospital had to cut some costly programs like obstetrics, outsourced others like their ambulance service and did without needed upgrades to their equipment. They also cobbled together some small grants, and in 2015 they did net a profit: $52,503.</p><p>“People might look at us and say, ‘See, you didn’t need Medicaid expansion. You’re still there,” Noble says. “But how long are we going to be here if we don’t get some relief?”</p>
            <h2>Future Threats: Funding Caps</h2>
            <p>Since it didn’t expand Medicaid, Missouri has less on the line with the proposed Medicaid funding rollbacks. But the GOP plan would still have serious repercussions.</p>
            <p>It would switch Medicaid to a capped funding structure. Right now for every dollar spent through Medicaid, the federal government will match up everything the state spends. And it’s an entitlement program so as long as there is a need, that money will get spent even when the costs increase.</p>
            <p>Under the GOP health plan, the federal government would cap the amount it contributes to the states for its portion of Medicaid. And while that amount would increase by 3.7 percent per Medicaid enrollee per year, the Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/americanhealthcareact.pdf">estimates</a> the cost per enrollee would increase by 4.4 percent per year.</p>

                “I don’t know of any organization that can give away 20 percent of what they do and still be in business."
            </aside>
            <p>States would need to decide to make up that difference with their own money, or cut services. In Missouri certain Medicaid programs are already on the <a href="http://kbia.org/post/can-states-block-grant-medicaid-if-congress-doesnt-its-complicated#stream/0">chopping block</a>&nbsp;amid a budget crunch. Reducing the federal funding for the program risks causing more Missourians to lose insurance coverage.</p>
            <p>In Pemiscot County, Kerry Noble says the uncompensated care to uninsured county residents already makes up 20 percent of his hospital’s business. “I don’t know of any organization that can give away 20 percent of what they do and still be in business,” he says.</p>
            <p>Like most rural hospitals, the margins are slim in Pemiscot County. Even a small change — much less a big one like slashing Medicaid — could close the hospital for good.</p>
